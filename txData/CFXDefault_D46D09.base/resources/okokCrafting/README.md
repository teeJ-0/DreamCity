Hi, thank you for buying my script, I'm very grateful!

You can find everything you need to set okokCrafting up in the config file.
You should add the item images inside the icons folder "okokCrafting/web/icons".
The images name should be EXACTLY the same that is in your server's database.
The images format MUST BE ".png", otherwise they won't show up.

[IMPORTANT]
The 'tableID' field on the config file is used to create the craft buttons, so make sure you ALWAYS set a different ID for each table.
